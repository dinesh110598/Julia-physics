The articles are intended to be fairly basic treatments of various concepts that involve the use of computer programming in physics. They aren't necessarily comprehensive or self-contained but I'll try to cite more detailed sources as much as possible. Topics can range from simple mathematical concepts like algebra and probability illustrated using code to pretty advanced ones like quantum computing and machine learning algorithms- not in any particular order.

We'll primarily use the Julia programming language for coding, whose output comes rendered within the articles (thanks to Quarto). Julia has important advantages like speed, simplicity, great community, emojis ðŸ˜‰ and Greek Î±-bet, to best deal with physics. There'll be a link to a Pluto notebook version of every article- they allow hands-on tinkering of the code after a simple setup! Python and Jupyter notebooks may be used occassionally if the occassion demands. The top priority overall will be for the articles to look more physics-y and less code-y.

Me? I'm a researcher studying and working on machine learning and computational physics algorithms- and this is a fun side-project, for now. Please feel free to reach out for comments, love and criticism...

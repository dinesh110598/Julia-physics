This is a leisure project that explores the idea of language, math and code going hand in hand for exploring physics- using the Julia programming language, which has speed, simplicity, elegance, emojis üòµ‚Äçüí´ and the most important of all: Greek $\alpha$-bet!

A book on classical physics [@sussman2015structure] is based on the the same approach but they didn't use Julia- so this was not meant for mere mortals like me. So I decided to write this, borrowing liberally from here and other sources that would be cited as much as possible. Would gladly quote any sources that seem to explain particular topics *better* (simpler or more detailed) as well.

We have both static pages and **Pluto notebooks** which can be run interactively either using an online host or locally on your machine. [Here's an example to fool around with](Classical-Mechanics/Vectors_kinematics/Vectors_tut.html).

title: Julia language resources

Let me state up front that Julia itself has a pretty simple and intuitive syntax for beginners and one probably doesn't need too many guides/tutorials to understand the code we write. For example, simple functions can be defined just the way we write down on paper:

```
Ïˆ(x) = cos(x) + sin(x)
```

That being said, the best way to learn something is to **do it**. [Install Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/) (preferably Linux or MacOS) on your computer first. Add the [Pluto package](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl#lets-do-it), import and `Pluto.run()`, watch it open a browser window, which let's you open either a fresh window or pre-made notebooks with introductory tutorials of some essential packages, as well as load user saved notebooks.

If you're familiar with either Matlab or Python (Numpy), here's a [cheatsheet](https://cheatsheets.quantecon.org/) for common Julia functionality.

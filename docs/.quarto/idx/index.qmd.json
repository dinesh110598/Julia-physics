The aim is to explore some algorithms- both numeric and symbolic that can help us understand general concepts. Plots and widgets would be added for visual aid.\n\nA book on classical physics [@sussman2015structure] is based on the the same approach but they didn't use Julia- so this was not meant for mere mortals like me. So I decided to write this, borrowing liberally from here and other sources that would be cited as much as possible. Would gladly quote any sources that seem to explain particular topics *better* (simpler or more detailed) as well.\n\nWe have both static pages and **Pluto notebooks** which can be run interactively either using an online host or locally on your machine. [Here's an example to fool around with](Classical-Mechanics/Vectors_kinematics/Vectors_tut.html).\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-yaml":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.1.251","theme":"spacelab","title":"Welcome","bibliography":["ref.bib"]},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}

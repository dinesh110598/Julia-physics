{"title":"Plans","markdown":{"headingText":"Plans","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"- [ ] Create a Newton's laws tutorial with numerical functions *generated* from Symbolics pkg rather than hardcoding them.\n  - There's a good site that alludes to the use of symbolics in physics. Precompiling symbolics generated numerical functions maybe tricky and **unnecessary** for tutorials. But maybe mention this as a sidenote.\n  - Spend enough time to set this up. No hurry at all.\n- I would assume people already know the math and even physics to a basic extent. Emphasis will be on computer-intensive or enabled concepts and workflow.\n- An article about the advantages of Julia:\n  - It's fast, has a simple syntax.\n  - Easy building and reproducing of environments\n  - Multiple dispatch with `struct`s. More physics-like than Python's OOP.\n  - Simple and great plotting packages.\n  - Symbolics that talks well with numerics\n  - Easy to build and register own packages\n\n## To do\n- Start with the basics of vector calculus with simple library code and graphs.\n  - [ ] Do we already have a simple library for this? The functionality in Makie with `Point` objects seems sufficient for plotting. Find a coding API that integrates nicely with Symbolics.\n  - [ ] This would probably be minimal though. Maybe the first half of an exercise on Newtonian mechanics.\n  - [ ] Study CairoMakie more carefully and figure out a way to make user-friendly 2D plots that don't overlap. One 3D plot can be shown for the sake of visualization though.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"notes.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":"spacelab"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}

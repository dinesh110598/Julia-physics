This means the position of any point object is a *vector* from a chosen *origin* that can always be represented as a linear combination of 3 basis vectors. Computers always represent vectors as a list of numbers. \n\n::: {.cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.julia .cell-code}\nusing CairoMakie, GeometryBasics\n\nO = Point(0, 0) # Origin in 2D vector space\nx̂ = Point(1, 0) # Basis vector along x\nŷ = Point(0, 1) # Basis vector along y\n#ẑ = Point(0, 1, 0) # Basis vector along z\n\nfig, ax, b1 = arrows([O, O], [x̂, ŷ], color=\"red\",\n                     ax = (; backgroundcolor=\"transparent\"),\n                     fig = (; backgroundcolor=\"transparent\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=2}\n![Basis vectors in 2D](main_files/figure-html/fig-basis-vec-output-1.svg){#fig-basis-vec}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n[Visualizing vector algebra and calculus- Pluto notebook](Vectors_tut.html)\n\nObjects in space evolve with time, a scalar quantity.

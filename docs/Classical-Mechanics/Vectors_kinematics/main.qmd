The world, or more precisely the *space* around us is 3 dimensional. This means the position of any point object is a *vector* from a chosen *origin* that can always be represented as a linear combination of 3 basis vectors. Computers always represent vectors as a list of numbers. 

```{julia}
#| label: fig-basis-vec
#| fig-cap: "Basis vectors in 2D"
using CairoMakie, GeometryBasics

O = Point(0, 0) # Origin in 3D vector space
x̂ = Point(1, 0) # Basis vector along x
ŷ = Point(0, 1) # Basis vector along y
#ẑ = Point(0, 1, 0) # Basis vector along z

fig, ax, b1 = arrows([O, O], [x̂, ŷ], color="red",
                     ax = (; backgroundcolor="transparent"),
                     fig = (; backgroundcolor="transparent"))
```

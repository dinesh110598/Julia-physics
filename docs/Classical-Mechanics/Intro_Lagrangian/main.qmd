Principle of least action or Lagrangian mechanics is a formulation of classical physics that can be thought of as a generalization to Newtonian mechanics where we don't have to use "real" or *Cartesian* coordinates to describe the positions and corresponding velocities of every particle. We can in fact incorporate *constraints* on the interaction between various particles and potentially reduce the number of required coordinates to what's known as *degrees of freedom* of a system.

Lagrangian mechanics can describe systems beyond the ones that can be described using Newtonian mechanics like relativistic systems and field systems like (classical) electrodynamics. It also forms the basis of the path integral approach to quantum mechanics. It's the starting point to Hamiltonian mechanics, which is the foundation for the Schrodinger/Heisenberg quantum mechanics as well as quantum field theories. Hamiltonians are also the basis of (canonical) statistical physics which combines with quantum mechanics to yield condensed matter physics! So the importance of Lagrangians perhaps cannot be overstated.

## Illustrating the action principle
> The state of a physical system in the Lagrangian formulation is given by the **time**, (generalized) **coordinates** and (generalized) **velocities** along every degree of freedom[^1]. 

[^1]: There are some caveats- like the coordinates are in fact maps from abstract *topological manifolds* and that time can sometimes refer to both a parameter or a coordinate.

For all the fuss about generalized coordinates, we'll start from the simplest Newtonian example of a free particle in a 1D space with a single Cartesian coordinate. **Action** is a scalar function of paths between two fixed points in a coordinate-time graph of a system. The physical path taken by the system evolving between these two points is the one that minimizes this action. *Any* other path is decreed unphysical.

Say we have two points A and B on the coordinate-time graph of the free particle. From Newton's second law, we know the physical path is a straight line between them.

We have a (black) physical path and some (blue) unphysical paths between A and B. Note that the black line does minimize a pretty interesting quantity: the path length $l$. So whatever this action (call it $S$) is, it ought to be proportional to the path length!

$$
S \propto l
$$

This delightful observation could probably have been the historical motivation to pursue this. I can indeed vaguely recollect that an action principle was being used to explain straight line trajectories of light rays. It's also useful to ~~write~~ type down the expression to evaluate the path length of a generic path $q(t)$:

$$
l = \int \sqrt{dq^2 + dt^2} = \int_0^1 dt \sqrt{\left(\frac{dq}{dt}\right)^2 + 1}
$$ {#eq-path-length}

It's also important avoid, in Einstein's words "spooky action at a distance". The dynamics of *any* physical system depends only on the coordinates and its derivatives at present time and not on its history. For the action principle, this means that action of a path must be the integral of a *local* quantity on the path (depends only on time, coordinates and their derivatives, $\dot q, \ddot q...$ at that time). This quantity is known as the **Lagrangian**, $L$. So we can write:

$$
S = \int_0^1 dt L(q(t), \dot q(t), \ddot q(t),... t)
$$

To justify this, imagine we break down the path $q(t)$ into infinitesimal pieces. Since the dynamics is local, every piece would have a minimized differential action $dS$ irrespective of the other pieces. Hence, $dS$ must be expressed in terms of a local quantity aka the Lagrangian at time $t$:

$$
dS(t) = L(q(t), \dot q(t), \ddot q(t),... t) dt
$$ {#eq-differential-action}

However in order to have a *unique* physical path between 2 points, the Lagrangian must depend only on the coordinates and velocities and not higher order derivatives:

$$
L = L(q, \dot q, t)
$$ {#eq-lagrangian-first-order}

It's no accident that the expression for path length $l$ in @eq-path-length also has the form of an integral over a Lagrangian, with $L = \sqrt{\dot q^2 + 1}$. But unfortunately, it's so close yet not there. The true Lagrangian of a free particle is *defined* to be the particle's kinetic energy, giving $L(q, \dot q) = \frac{m \dot q^2}{2}$. In fact, the general prescription for any Newtonian system with (potential) forces for the Lagrangian would be the difference between total kinetic and potential energies:

$$
L(\vec q, \dot{\vec{q}}, t) = m \frac{\dot{\vec{q}}.\dot{\vec{q}}}{2} - V(\vec q)
$$ {#eq-newton-lagrangian}

Typical textbooks on classical mechanics would've led straight to deriving a set of differential equations known as the *Euler-Lagrange* equations that yield Newton's equations of motions for justifying the prescription in @eq-newton-lagrangian. It's also possible to justify @eq-lagrangian-first-order using a property of order 2 ODEs.

## Theoretical and numerical exercises
We'll try to tackle the principle of least action by directly minimizing the action over all (not *all* of course) possible paths instead of solving differential equations. **Where do we do it?** Here are some exercises in the form of Pluto notebooks with Julia code:

- [Free particle in 1D- theoretical approach with graphs](./Canon_ex.html)
- [Particle in 2D under gravity and probably any other problem- a generic numerical approach]()

**Why do we do it?** Perhaps not necessary for classical physics- differential equations are both analytically and computationally simpler to deal with than variations over paths. But in the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics where all paths are equally physical (some of them indeed more equal than the others, as in @orwell2021animal), such numerical methods may be useful.
